# Hey up!
I'm Francisco, and since Dec 2022, I've been living in the UK. It's been a fascinating experience, full of new activities, some exciting food, and many beautiful landscapes.

I've spent a good chunk of my career in the field of water resources. Right now, I'm diving into the world of data science and visualisation. This is where I feel at home, deciphering the cryptic language of data and transforming it into visuals that are easy to understand and a joy to behold.

Check out the projects I'm working on at the moment. They're a blend of hard work, creativity, and a genuine passion for what I do. They show the power of data, and how it can be used to tell compelling stories and make complex ideas simple.

Thanks for being here and for being a part of my journey. I can't wait to see where this adventure takes me next!
