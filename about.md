# Hey up!

I'm Francisco. I'm a Chilean guy and since Dec 2022 I've been living in England. It's been a fascinating experience, self challenging, full of new activities, beautiful landscapes and rather diverse people.

I've spent a good chunk of my career in the field of water resources and analytics. Right now, I'm finding connection with the world of data science. 

Check out the projects I'm working on at the moment. They're a blend of hard work, creativity, and a genuine passion for what I do.

Thanks for being here and for being a part of my journey. I can't wait to see where this adventure takes me next!
