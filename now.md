Taking inspiration from my current read, "The Art of Learning", I've embarked on a series of personal experiments. I'm pushing my boundaries, confronting challenges, and seeking a deeper understanding of myself and how I interact with the world around me. Each experiment is a step forward (or backwards) to self-improvement, a chance to grow and become more aware of my limits.
A non ordered (or complete) list of experiments:
- join a random class in the gym
- play table tennis only using my backhand
- cooking something new!
- taking a longer route to home
- following some Dr. Hubberman advice: 20 minutes aerobic exercise, no phone in the morning-night, glass of water to start the day.
- journal daily (it has worked yet)
- try new food

Away from the screen, I'm getting to grips with life in the UK. Even though I've been here for a while, there's always something new to discover. Whether it's a historical landmark, a cultural tradition, or simply a beautiful view, living here is an adventure I'm thoroughly enjoying.

Keep an eye on this page for updates on what I'm up to. As my story continues to unfold, I'm excited to share it with you.

If you've got any questions, ideas, or just fancy a chat, don't hesitate to get in touch.
