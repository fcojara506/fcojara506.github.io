Taking inspiration from my current read, "The Art of Learning", I've embarked on a series of personal experiments. I'm pushing my boundaries, confronting challenges, and seeking a deeper understanding of myself and how I interact with the world around me. Each experiment is a step forward (or backwards) to self-improvement, a chance to grow and become more aware of my limits.
A non ordered (or complete) list of experiments:
- join a random class in the gym
- play table tennis only using my backhand
- cooking something new!
- taking a longer route to home
- following some Dr. Hubberman advice: 20 minutes aerobic exercise, no phone in the morning-night, glass of water to start the day.
- journal daily (it has worked yet)
- try new food

Away from the screen, I'm getting to grips with life in the UK. Even though I've been here for a while, there's always something new to discover. There is different way to approach nature, which expresses for example in lots of home gardens and lovely botanical gardens.

I practice table tennis on Wednesdays and Fridays in the Community club. The physical part is always evolving as I discover new players with intricate strategies. In England compared to Chile, I find intriguing that a lot of people drills are excellent but lose easily in the games. I think people in Chile tend to hide their abilities to surprise in the game.
