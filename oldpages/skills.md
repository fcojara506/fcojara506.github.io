### GIS

I have several years of experience with GIS software, primarily with ArcGIS 10.x suite (Map, Catalog, ArcPy, Globe, and Scene) but also with some open source software such as QGIS and command line utilities such as GDAL and OGR. Though, it is my firm belief that knowledge of software is secondary to understanding the systematic framework to approaching geographic problems. Advancements in GIS software has lowered the basic know	ledge required to produce a map often leading to less than adequate results that may be misleading or down right wrong. I once heard it said, “GIS: an elegant way of creating rubbish.”

### Computer Skills

I am proficient with the Microsoft Office Suite including experience with Access. I have several years of experience with Linux systems mostly using the Debian based Ubuntu, and Arch Linux distributions. I have run personal web and file servers. I tend to script anything I do more than once leading me to develop experience with Bash, Python, and R. Other programming languages in my repertoire include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Current Duties

I am currently employed as a GIS analyst in the Mladenoff forest landscape ecology lab at the University of Wisconsin Madison. My main task is to lend technical support to a project studying the tension zone in Wisconsin. I also work part time as a GIS developer at the UW Sea Grant Institute managing map/GIS related servers and customizing web applications to fit the Sea Grant Institutes specific needs.

### Other

I have had four semesters of Swedish at university with moderate command of the language both written and spoken. Men det finns inte många människor som talar det.
