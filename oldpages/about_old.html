					My name is Hayden Elza and I am a Forester and GIS Specialist.
					<br>
					My interests are in how GIS, or technology in general, can be used in the field of forestry. This interest is not limited to research, as it also extends to every day tasks such as routine forest inventories and optimizing workflow to produce better quality management plans that benefit both the forest and people whom depend on it.

					In my free time I enjoy tinkering and hacking. My habit is to learn by doing. For instance, one of the first python programs I wrote was to use a RaspberryPi to control the motor controllers in a small robot that could drive around and control a front bucket using a Wii-mote. For me learning in context is important skill for developing a long lasting, useful knowledge base.

					“One final paragraph of advice: do not burn yourselves out. Be as I am — a reluctant enthusiast... a part-time crusader, a half-hearted fanatic. Save the other half of yourselves and your lives for pleasure and adventure. It is not enough to fight for the land; it is even more important to enjoy it. While you can. While it’s still here. So get out there and hunt and fish and mess around with your friends, ramble out yonder and explore the forests, climb the mountains, bag the peaks, run the rivers, breathe deep of that yet sweet and lucid air, sit quietly for a while and contemplate the precious stillness, the lovely, mysterious, and awesome space. Enjoy yourselves, keep your brain in your head and your head firmly attached to the body, the body active and alive, and I promise you this much; I promise you this one sweet victory over our enemies, over those desk-bound men and women with their hearts in a safe deposit box, and their eyes hypnotized by desk calculators. I promise you this; You will outlive the bastards.”
