				<h1>Skills</h1><br><br>
				<h2>GIS</h2><br>
				<p class="text">
					I have several years of experience with GIS software, primarily with ArcGIS 10.x suite (Map, Catalog, ArcPy, Globe, and Scene) but also with some open source software such as QGIS and command line utilities such as GDAL and OGR. Though, it is my firm belief that knowledge of software is secondary to understanding the systematic framework to approaching geographic problems. Advancements in GIS software has lowered the basic know	ledge required to produce a map often leading to less than adequate results that may be misleading or down right wrong. I once heard it said, “GIS: an elegant way of creating rubbish.”
				</p><br><br>
				<h2>Computer Skills</h2><br>
				<p class="text">
					 I have worked with most Windows versions including Windows Server 2008 and am proficient with the Microsoft Office Suite including experience with Access. I also have several years of experience with Linux systems mostly using the Debian based Ubuntu, and Arch Linux distributions. I have run personal web and file servers gaining experience with Apache and SFTP. I also tend to script anything I do more than once leading me to develop experience with Bash, Python, and R. Other programming languages in my repertoire include HTML and CSS, with a little bit of experience with JavaScript.
				</p><br><br>
				<h2>Current Duties</h2><br>
				<p class="text">
					I am currently employed as a system administrator and web developer at the UW Sea Grant Institute working with open source geo-servers. This includes MapServer, GeoServer, GeoNetwork, PostGIS, PostgreSQL, and OpenGeoPortal. I am also employed as a GIS specialist in the Mladenoff Forest Landscape Ecology lab working on a plethora of projects including assessing wetlands loss in Wisconsin since pre-settlement time, Bordner map digitization initiative, and other small projects and map/data requests.
				</p><br><br>
				<h2>Other</h2><br>
				<p class="text">
					I have had four semesters of Swedish at university with moderate command of the language both written and spoken. Men det finns inte många människor som talar det.
